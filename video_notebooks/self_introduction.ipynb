    "Hi, my name is Linden Lu. I grew up in Beijing, China. After getting a bachelor's degree in computer science from Tsinghua university, I came to the States in 1997 and got a masters degree in computer science from Indiana University. I worked for over ten years as a software engineer and consultant in various industries including publication, e-commerce, media, finance and insurance, mainly in California.\n",

    "I moved to Champaign with my family in 2006 and later got masters in Finance from the university of Illinois. I joined the Gies College of Business in 2017 and I have been teaching data analytics to accounting students since then, both on campus and online. I love interacting with students. This is truly my dream job because it combines my expertise in programming and analytics with my passion in teaching. \n",

    "In my spare time, I enjoy all kinds of sports, among which, golf is my favorite. I'm going to show you my home golf course, university of Illinois golf course today.\n",

    "Here we are on the first tee of the orange course. There are actually two 18-hole courses in this facility, orange and blue. The first hole on orange is a 540-yard, par 5 hole. On a good day, with the help of tail wind, I can reach the green in two shots. Let's see what I can do today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, I hooked my tee shot into the woods on the left. Let's just hope I can find my ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, here's my ball. It's surrounded by big trees. I have two options here, the first is to chip the ball sideway to the fairway, hopefully save par from there. With this approach, I'm not likely to get a birdie, but I should be able to score no worse than a bogie. Another option is to take risk and go for the green. There's a small opening to the green. If I can hit the ball through the gap and get close to the green, I have a good chance to get a birdie. But if the ball doesn't get through, I'm in deep trouble and could get double bogie or worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I've tracked all my shots I hit before like a lot of pro golfers do, I can analyze my shots, evaluate my results under similar situation and make the best decision based on my data. But apparently I don't have that data so I'll follow my gut today and go for the green from here.\n",

    "(Ball bounce back off a tree)  \n",
    "Watch out!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Whew, that was close. Maybe I should start tracking my shots so that I can make better decision based on data next time.\n"
