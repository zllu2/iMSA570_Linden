    "\n",
    "In this project, you will finish the first three steps in the data analytics framework CRISP-DM, business understanding, data understanding and data preparation on the LendingClub dataset. You will also start on the fourth step of the CRISP-DM framework, modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a template of the project report, which consists of 20 mini-tasks. The first 18 mini-tasks are worth 4 percentage points each. The last two mini-tasks require more effort, so they are worth more points. The 19th mini-task is worth 10 percentage points, and the twentieth mini-task is worth 18 percentage points. Thus, the total is 100 percentage points. The number of percentage points that you earn will be multiplied by the 280 points for this project (see the syllabus) to determine the number of points that will go towards calculating your final grade. For example, if you earn 90% then you'll receive 252 points (.9*280) for the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the visualizations should be properly labeled and titled.\n",

    "This is an individual project. You may use your notes, but you should not seek for help from anyone currently enrolled in this course, or who has taken this course before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to upload this completed file by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, March 15th.\n"
