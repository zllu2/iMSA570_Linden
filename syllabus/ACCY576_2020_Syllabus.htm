<h2 id="a1">Course Description</h2>
<p>This course focuses on developing Python skills for assembling business data. It will cover some of the same material from Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization, but in a more general purpose programming environment (Jupyter Notebook for Python), rather than in Excel and the Visual Basic Editor. These concepts are taught within the context of one or more accounting data domains (e.g., financial statement data from EDGAR, stock data, loan data, point-of-sale data).</p>
<p>The first half of the course picks up where Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization left off: using in an integrated development environment to automate data analytic tasks. We discuss how to manage code and share results within Jupyter Notebook, a popular development environment for data analytic software like Python and R. We then review some fundamental programming skills, such as mathematical operators, functions, conditional statements and loops using Python software.</p>
<p>The second half of the course focuses on assembling data for machine learning purposes. We introduce students to Pandas dataframes and Numpy for structuring and manipulating data. We then analyze the data using visualizations and linear regression. Finally, we explain how to use Python for interacting with SQL data.</p>
<h2 id="a2">Goals, Objectives, and Topics</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Know how to operate software that will help you create and run Python code.</li>

<h2 id="a4">Elements of the Course</h2>
<p>This University of Illinois course for graduate credit or academic credit will be conducted through two platforms: (1) the <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Compass 2g course management system</a>, which will be your main point of contact, and (2) the Coursera Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform where you will need to register and complete one MOOC brought to you by the University of Illinois. The Coursera MOOC is titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-data-analytics-python/home/welcome" target="_blank">Accounting Data Analytics with Python</a>.</p>
<h3>Live Sessions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tuesdays, 8:30 AM–10:00 AM and 8:15 PM–9:45 PM US Central Time
<ul>
<li>These sessions are designed to mainly discuss cases, readings, and assignments from just completed module(s) and to preview the same from immediately upcoming module(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to get more value from this course, try to fit these live sessions into your schedule and participate.</li>
<li>Live sessions will be recorded, and the recordings will generally be available within one hour after the last live session concludes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fridays 6:00 to 7:00 PM US Central Time and by appointment</li>
<li>The office hours provide students an additional opportunity to log in and ask questions, and thus, they serve as an additional resource to the discussion forums.</li>
<li>These times will be open and informal for student questions and will not be recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-4046048-dt-content-rid-48828512_1/courses/accy_576_120201_184194/ACCY%20576%20Syllabus%20SP20%20HTML.html#a11">(Back to Top)</a></p>
<h2 id="a5">Assignments, Exams, and Grading</h2>
<h3>Assignment and Exam Information</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Session Quizzes&nbsp; </strong>There will be a short quiz during every live session. These quizzes assess your understanding of the Coursera&nbsp;material as well as ask for your opinions. We will use the quiz results to guide the live session discussions. If you're not able to attend either of the live sessions, a link will be posted so that you can&nbsp;take the quiz at a time that's convenient for you as long as it's before the deadline.</li>
<li><strong>HE (High Engagement)&nbsp;Programming Assignment&nbsp;</strong> These programming assignments (based on&nbsp;Jupyter&nbsp;Notebooks)&nbsp;are similar to and an extension of the&nbsp;Jupyter Notebook assignments that are posted on Coursera. Specifically, you will be asked to perform a greater number of coding tasks that require more thought than the tasks in the Jupyter Notebook assignments on Coursera. It is intended that you complete these notebook assignments after having completed the module's&nbsp;Coursera material&nbsp;and after either attending the live session or viewing the live session recording and before the deadline.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Final Project&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The final project will give you an opportunity to go through the CRISP-DM framework for analyzing financial data in Python. You will be given a dataset and will be asked to perform a number of tasks associated with understanding, preparing, and modeling the data. This final project will be made available during the week of module 5.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p><strong>The deadline of the assignments in this course is at the end of the module, which is 11:59 PM US Central Time, Sundays.</strong> Any exception will be specified in the course schedule.</p>
<p>Each module starts on Monday and ends on Sunday in the iMSA courses.</p>
<p>Please pay special attention to the deadlines posted here in Compass2g. These are the hard deadlines for all activities in this Compass course. You will also see deadlines posted in Coursera or in emails from Coursera; those are suggested deadlines that your instructor expects you to follow in order to prepare you for the weekly assignments in the Compass course. These may differ from the deadlines posted in Compass. In cases of mismatch, Compass is the source of truth for all course deadlines. The hard deadline for MOOC assignments is the end of this 8-week Compass2g course. In another word, by the end of this course, you should finish both MOOC assignments and Compass2g assignments by the end of module 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of any course, read and know the course syllabus and note <strong>all deadlines</strong> for assignments, and exam requirements including any exams or assignments that have time limits. The iMSA program has strict rules around deadlines and submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Late submissions of assignments made within one week after the deadline will be accepted with a 25% penalty. Submissions made more than one week after the deadline will not be accepted. Any exceptions will be at the discretion of the program. Faculty will determine the extension deadline for approved exceptions. Once the answer key is posted, late submissions are not accepted for any reason.</strong> When at all possible, requests for an exception should be made <strong>BEFORE</strong> the assignment deadline.</p>
<p>Students who experience a serious extenuating circumstance beyond their control that prevents submission of an assignment or exam may request an exception to this policy by providing documentation of the extenuating circumstance to the online program at <a href="mailto:imsa-support@illinois.edu">imsa-support@illinois.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Extenuating circumstances that may result in an exception:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unforeseen hospitalization of the student or an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent)</li>
<li>Death of an immediate family member</li>
<li>Another similar event (natural disaster, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Circumstances that would not warrant an exception includes business travel, minor illnesses, internet access, etc. Such requests will not be granted. We ask you to plan in advance if there is uncertainty in your schedule or course work environment.</p>
<p>For additional information about rules and policies established by the University, please refer to the Student Code at <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/" title="Student Code" target="_blank">http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/</a></p>

<h2 id="a7">University Honor Code</h2>
<p>Academic integrity and honesty are essential and non-negotiable. It is your duty to not only understand and abide by University guidelines (Read Article I, Part 4: Academic Integrity of the Illinois <a href="http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/" target="_blank">Student Code</a> but also to promote a culture of ethical behavior within your group and class. Ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty. Violations will be handled via Department, School, and University policies.)</p>
<p>According to the University policy, violation of academic integrity is a serious offense. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to the following examples. In the context of all assignments in this course, violating academic integrity is copying of answers from other students or any other source, rather than authoring them. Other violations of academic integrity include sharing exams with others and posting exams or exam questions online. Quoting from other sources, including course readings and transcripts, with proper citation is permitted, but that cannot be the entire answer. Quotations may only constitute part of your answer, and must be merely for clarification or documentation purposes. Your answers must show that you have understood the material and can argue the case on your own. Anyone found in violation of academic integrity in this course will be subject to the penalties discussed in the <a href="http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/" target="_blank">Student Code</a>. These penalties include, among others, failure for the course or dismissal from the University.</p>
<h2 id="a8">Disability Resources and Educational Services</h2>
<p>To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1208 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 217-333-4603 (V/TDD), or e-mail a message to <a href="mailto:disability@illinois.edu">disability@illinois.edu</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require assistance to participate in this class are asked to see the instructor as soon as possible.</p>
