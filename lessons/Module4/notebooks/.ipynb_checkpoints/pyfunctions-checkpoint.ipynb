    "In a previous notebook, we introduced functions, which provide a concise mechanism to encapsulate code that can promote code reuse. But when writing code in Python, functions are even more powerful. This notebook discusses several more advanced function concepts including functions as objects, nested functions, scope, variable length arguments, lambda functions, and decorators. Mastery of these concepts, especially the last few, is not required to be able to use Python for data analytics. However, you should be familiar with them in order to understand code that others write or in future lessons where they may be used to provide more concise technical solutions.\n",

    "We have routinely defined names, or variables, when writing Python scripts and assigned values to these names. So far, this has generally been a variable, and we have assigned a value to this name, for example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Julio'\n",
    "amount = 1000\n",
    "price = 105.75\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, in Python everything is an object, which means that all types of things can be assigned to names or variables. Interestingly enough, this also includes functions. As a result, we can assign a defined function to a variable, pass a function into another function as an argument, and access functions from variables. This concept is demonstrated in the following Code cell where we define a simple function that displays a welcome message and assign this new function `test_function` to the `my_func` variable. As the cell results demonstrate, the variable holds an object of type `<class 'function'>`, and when the variable is accessed directly the name and address for the function are displayed.\n",

    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you work with a computer, you are using programs. Think about a word processor, spreadsheet, browser, or email client. These are all examples of large programs that contain many lines of code. This code will contain many objects like variables or functions potentially written by many different people over many years. When these programs are executed, all of these objects have to be used correctly. If you think about a large room full of people, invariably there will be many people who share names, and a computer program will likely be similar, so how does the computer keep track of everything and avoid name collisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple answer is **scope**; an object has limited scope and is only seen within a specific portion of a program. Thus, it is important to understand scope, or you may try to use an object, like a variable, where it may be undefined, or you may accidentally reuse a name and cause a different problem. In Python, there are basically four scope levels (ignoring classes as object-oriented programming is beyond the _scope_ of this class). These levels are, in order of increasing visibility:\n",

    "1. Local,\n",
    "2. Enclosing-function,\n",
    "3. Global, and\n",
    "4. Built-In.\n",

    "Local scope refers to variables defined within a specific function; these objects are only visible within the function where they are declared. An object defined in an enclosing function is visible anywhere within that function, including in a function defined inside that function (also known as _nested functions_). An object defined at the top of a file, either a program, a module file (which is discussed in a latter lesson), or a notebook like this one is visible through that file and inside functions defined in that file. Finally, any name defined that is built-in to the Python language (like `range`, `len`, `print`, or exception names, like `SyntaxError`) is visible anywhere in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate _scope_  in the following Code cell. We first define a simple function and show how the variables defined inside the function are only visible in that function, while the variables defined outside the function (but before it is called) are visible inside the function. Notice how we have defined a variable called `b` both before the function call, which in this case is in _Global_ scope, and inside the function, which is in _Local_ scope. Inside the function, the locally defined variable hides the global variable, and any changes to the local variable are not reflected in the global variable. However, the global scope variable `a` is visible inside the function\n",

While we can access the value of the global scope variable (or call a function that has a broader scope level), we cannot modify its value inside the functions or we either get an unexpected result or we raise an `UnboundLocalError` exception. The reason why is that if we try to change a variable by using an assignment, we either create a new local scope variable (e.g., `a = 10`) that hides the global variable, or we try to reference a local variable before it is defined (e.g., `a += 10`).\n",

In this case, Python provides the `nonlocal` keyword, which indicates that a name is not local and not global, and instead should be taken from the enclosing function. This is demonstrated in the following Code cell where we have a variable named `b` defined in the global scope, in the enclosing function scope, and in the local scope inside the nested function.

    "When Python functions were first introduced in an earlier lesson, function arguments were passed to a function in two ways: values and keyword value pairs. For example, given the following functions definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(name, price, amount = 1):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Process data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we could invoke this function by passing values: `my_function('Zhou', 10.50, 100)` or by passing keyword value pairs: `my_function(name='Zhou', price=10.50, amount=100)`. In some cases, however, a function might accept a large range of arguments that may or may not need to be passed to the function. For example, many plotting functions in the _Seaborn_ visualization library accept dictionaries to control a plot's appearance, which are passed to the _Matplotlib_ library to generate the actual data visualization. As a result, the programmer can specify only those arguments that are required to control the appearance of the final visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is known formally as variable length function arguments, and by using this technique, one can write functions that behave in different ways depending on both the number of parameters passed to the function and their value. To make this work, there are several important rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable-length arguments must be at the end of the argument list; any named argument must appear first.\n",
    "2. Variable-length arguments passed solely by value must come next. Formally these are received as a tuple by the function and are generally programmatically handled by using a variable called `args`.\n",
    "3. Variable-length keyword arguments come last and are formally received as a dictionary. Programmatically, this dictionary is typically handled by a variable called `kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to follow these rules can result in an exception, such as a `SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cell, we demonstrate a function processing a variable-length argument. First, notice how the variable-length argument is indicated in the function definition by using the `*args` parameter. This tells the Python interpreter that a known number of arguments will be passed by value into this function, and that all of them should be encapsulated as a tuple. Since a tuple is immutable, the values can't be changed. We also use the `enumerate` function to obtain both a loop counter and the item from the tuple. As the output of the two different function calls demonstrate, the results are received as a tuple and the values are iterated over to be displayed.\n",

    "\n",
    "The last advanced function capability we will address in this notebook are function decorators. A decorator is a way to add functionality to an existing function without changing the function itself. This can be useful if you want to add logging or debugging information to record the program state before and after a function, or you might need to acquire login credentials from a user before a function is called, perhaps to access sensitive data, or you may want to augment the output from a function to include additional data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any of these cases, the format for creating a function decorator is straightforward. First, we create the decorator as a function itself that takes a function as an argument. The decorator contains a nested function called `wrapper` that wraps the target function invocation. Finally, the decorator function returns the wrapper. Lastly, we call the decorator function with our target function as an argument and assign the result (which is the wrapper function) to the target function name. As a result, our original name now holds the wrapped function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is demonstrated in the following Code cell, where we wrap the `my_function` function by using the `my_decorator_function` decorator function. When the wrapped function is called, we see the original function called is wrapped such that work is done before and after the original function is called. In this case, the work is simply displaying a message, but in general could be much more complex.\n",

A second feature of this example is that we also show how to write a decorator for a function that takes an argument.
