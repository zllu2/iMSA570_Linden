    "## Writing Python Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces several important concepts that you should understand when writing Python programs. First, several readings will provide insight into popular software engineering techniques. If you work with software engineers, it is important to understand their approach to solving problems and the tools and techniques they use to develop useful software products. The notebook for this lesson extends these concepts by demonstrating how to create and execute a Python program. The notebook also introduces how a Python program can catch and handle error conditions, before demonstrating how to create and use Python modules, which simplify software reuse.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate basic skills every software developer should possess,\n",
    "- explain github and why it is so popular,\n",
    "- write and execute a simple Python program,\n",
    "- employ exception handling within a Python script, and\n",
    "- effectively use Python modules.\n",
