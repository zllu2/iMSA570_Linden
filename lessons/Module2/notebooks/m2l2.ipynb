    "## Python Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces Python conditional statements, which can be used to control how a computer executes a program. Formally, these statements use the `if` statement and its different variants, to control, based on a pre-defined condition, what code blocks are executed. The conditions used to determine which code blocks are executed must evaluate to a boolean value (i.e., `True` or `False`) and can involve combinations of different conditional and logical operations.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain basic boolean logic, which underlies the conditional test of an `if` statement,\n",
    "- articulate the differences between the logical operators, and \n",
    "- write effective `if` statements to perform conditional code evaluation.\n",
