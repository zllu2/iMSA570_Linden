    "# Module 3: Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "This module introduces two important programming concepts: data structures and iteration. Mastering data structures is an important task because a challenging problem can often be made much simpler by using proper data structures. Python provides several built-in data structures including the list, tuple, string, and dictionary. With such a rich set of data structures, iteration becomes an important concept as we can rapidly process data by iterating through the items in a data structure. This process is generally done by using the `for` statement, but this module also introduce the `while` statement and _comprehensions_. We will review a number of functions, which are built-in to these data structures, that increases the efficacy and general applicability of these data structures.\n",

    "#### By the end of this module, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create and use the Python list, tuple, string, and dictionary data structures,\n",
    "- explain the difference between mutable and immutable data structures and why both types are important,\n",
    "- effectively use iteration to process data in these data structures, and\n",
    "- apply built-in functions to manipulate data in these data structures.\n",
