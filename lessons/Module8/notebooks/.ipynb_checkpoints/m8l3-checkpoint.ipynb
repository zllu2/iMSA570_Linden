    "## Python Database Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to work with a SQL based database by using a Python program. This will include using the SQLite database module from within a Python program to connect to a database, execute queries, and process the results.  \n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand \n",
    "\n",
    "- the basic concepts involved in enabling a Python program to interact with a database,\n",
    "- how to query data by using a Python program, and\n",
    "- how to update data by using a Python program.\n",
    "- how to interact with a database with pandas DataFrame\n",
