    "## SQL: Advanced Concepts Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about several advanced SQL concepts and how to implement them in a SQLite database. First, primary keys and indexes are described, which are important for maintaining referential integrity and improving query performance. Second, table joins are introduced and the different types of joins supported by SQLite are demonstrated. Next, views, which map a name to a stored query, are introduced. Finally, we review how to modify the schema of an existing table.\n",
