    "## SQL: Advanced Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about several advanced SQL concepts and how to implement them in a SQLite database. First, primary keys and freign key are described, which are important for maintaining referential integrity. Second, table joins are introduced and the different types of joins supported by SQLite are demonstrated. Finally, we introduce how to return rows from query with certain order.\n",
