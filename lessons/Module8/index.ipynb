    "In this module, we will briefly introduce relational database management systems (RDBMS), still the most popular data storage technology. We will learn basic SQL, the language by which database users interact with a relational database. To test database and SQL concepts, we will use the open source database system known as SQLite. We will also look at connecting a Pandas DataFrame to a database.\n",
