    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces reading and writing data to a file by using the Python programming language. First, the Python context and the different modes by which a file can be opened (for reading, writing, or appending) are introduced.  Reading and writing simple text data is demonstrated by using vanilla Python. Secondly, reading and writing structured file with pandas is introduced. Finally, the Python concept of _pickling_ is demonstrated, by which complex Python data structures can easily be persisted.\n",
